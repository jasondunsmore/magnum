=============

Generates a Fedora Atomic image based on a public deployed tree. This element has been tested under Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and Fedora operating systems.

How to generate Fedora Atomic image
-----------------------------------
To generate an atomic image for Fedora 24 these commands can be
executed::

    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/magnum
    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/diskimage-builder.git
    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/dib-utils.git

    export PATH="${PWD}/dib-utils/bin:$PATH"
    export PATH="${PWD}/diskimage-builder/bin:$PATH"

    export ELEMENTS_PATH="${PWD}/diskimage-builder/elements"
    export ELEMENTS_PATH="${ELEMENTS_PATH}:${PWD}/magnum/magnum/drivers/common/image"

    export DIB_RELEASE=24     # this can be switched to the desired version
    export DIB_IMAGE_SIZE=2.5 # we need to give a bit more space to loopback device

    disk-image-create fedora-atomic -o fedora-atomic

This element can consume already published trees, but you can use it
to consume your own generated trees. Documentation about creating own trees
can be found at `http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/01/08/creating-custom-atomic-trees-images-and-installers-part-1/ <http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/01/08/creating-custom-atomic-trees-images-and-installers-part-1/>`_
